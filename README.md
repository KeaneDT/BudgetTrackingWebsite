For this ID Assignment 2 I have decided to use Html,Css,Javascript,Bootstrap and some APIs to make a budget tracker application that can be ued on both mobile and desktop. The name of this application is a simple one, Budget Tracker. I might improve on the name futher down the road. The application consists of 3 main parts, the title screen, the about section and the tracker itself. 

The tracker will use simple Javascript, to take the budget entered by the user to create the balance. There will be a month input to track the balance and expenses. The user can then input as many expense inputs as they want which will then be deducted from the balance. The user will be able to see all the expenses that they have added to be deducted from the balance. If the user had made a mistake, they will be able to clear the expenses list by clicking on a button. I will also add a feature that will alert the user if the balance has gone to 0 or less than 0. Once the user has input all the expenses for the month, they can click on the save button which will save the total expense cost and the balance for that month in the local storage of the website. The results of which will then be displayed being compared to other 'saved' inputs by the user for the previous months, using Charts.js. If the user chooses, they can clear the local storage of the website.

(I might find an API to make this process of tracking and logging data easier.)

Some additional features i would like to add to the website is a dark mode feature which will switch the color theme of the page upon clicking an icon.

# Reason

The main reason I am creating this application is to help people to keep track of their spending habits and alongside this, promote healthy spending habits. I think that overspending is an issue in this day and age as I have seen many people not set monthly budgets for themselves and spend an enormous amount of money on unnecessary expenses.

From the perspective of the user, I would like a simple to use application which would enable to log and track my spending habits. I believe that after consiously using this application for an extended period of time, budgeting would become a habit I unconsiously perform which will help me save up more money for the long run.

# Links to Wireframe

The Wireframe files can be found in the ID_S10202630_Keane Travasso_Wireframe folder.
It consists of 2 .xd files, one for the Desktop view and the other for the mobile view.

# Features to be implemented

-Allows users to input a budget which would set the initial value for the budget variable
-Allows users to input their expenses for the month which would be deducted from the balance variable
-Allows users to save the final balance once they have subtracted all their expenses
-Allows users to track their total expenses compared to other month inputs through the use of a line chart

Potential:
-Allows users to toggle on/off Dark Mode which would help for night-time use.

# Technology used

So far I have used Bootstrap, Jquery & Chart.Js to help me make the website.

I have also added nomalize css: https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/8.0.1/normalize.css
